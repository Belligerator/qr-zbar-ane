# Barcode Scanning for AIR Mobile Apps
## A Native Extension thats Fast and Smooth!
#### This library uses the [ZBar](https://github.com/ZBar/ZBar) Reader under the hood to provide barcode scanning for actionscript applications running on AIR Android or iOS.This supports QR Codes, EAN13, EAN8 and [Many More!!](https://github.com/saumitrabhave/qr-zbar-ane/blob/master/ASLib/src/com/sbhave/nativeExtensions/zbar/Symbology.as)

##### How To Use:
This library exposes APIs that will allow application developer to Scan the Barcodes in following two ways.
- __From Live Camera Feed__: You can place a camera feed (Rear or Front) using library APIs and just attach scanner to the feed to get DATA events whenever your Camera "sees" a Barcode.
- __From Bitmap/Image__: Developer can provide an arbitrary Image to Scan for a Barcode. *(Work In Progress)*

__Get Started__: 

__Step 1__: Link The ANE : Get the [Latest ANE](https://github.com/saumitrabhave/qr-zbar-ane/raw/master/qreader.ane) File from the root of the repository. Add it as a dependency in your favourite IDE.

> Note: Newer IDEs know what ANE means and you can link ANE files transperently. If you are using an older IDE, you may need to [google a bit](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS597e5dadb9cc1e0253f7d2fc1311b491071-8000.html) on how to link ANEs to your project.

__Step 2__: See the Samples: Have a look at some of the [manual tests](https://github.com/saumitrabhave/qr-zbar-ane/tree/master/Example/src/com/sbhave/reader/tests) I have written which can explain different uses of the APIs.

__Step 3__: See the Documentation : I have tried my best to document the available APIs in the code.[Read It!](https://github.com/saumitrabhave/qr-zbar-ane/blob/master/ASLib/src/com/sbhave/nativeExtensions/zbar/Scanner.as).
